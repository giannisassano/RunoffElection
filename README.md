# <h1>Runoff Election</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project runs an election in the runoff format. This means if a candidate has over 50% of the votes they will win, if not it will eliminate the contestant/s with the lowest number of votes and use their next highest rank vote as their main vote. The programme requires command line arguments to be entered of the candidates names up to a maximum of 9. It will then ask for the number of voter, up to the value of 100. It will then ask for the preference of the first voters votes, first being their favourite and last being their least. It will then do this for every voter and store the values. If there is an invalid vote it will return an error. This is when it will see if there is over 50% of votes for a candidate and if not, then it will begin eliminating the lowest voted candidates until there is a winner.
